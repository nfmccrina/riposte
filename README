What is Riposte?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Riposte is a utility for ripping audio CDs. It aims to be flexible and avoid
imposing a particular file storage/naming/tagging structure on the user. It
currently only supports the FLAC format, but MP3 and OGG support is on the
way.

Downloading
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Riposte can always be obtained from the Github repository,

Documentation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Riposte program is run as follows:

riposte [--cli] [--gui] [FILE]

When run with no arguments, the command-line interface will be started.
NOTE: currently only the command-line interface is implemented.

When started, the program will read settings from a preferences file. Settings
will be read from the FILE argument given at invocation, or if none was given
it will read ~/.riposte. The configuration file is a simple INI file. The
following options are supported:

    location: the directory where the audio files will be ripped to
    audioformat: specify FLAC, MP3, or OGG
    flacoptions: a list of arguments that will be passed to the flac encoder
    tmpdir: directory the program will use for temporary files
    
The command-line interface presents a series of prompts to the user. Press 'h'
at any time to display a contextual help menu.
